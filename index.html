                        <h2>Edison's Phonograph</h2>
                    <div>
                        In 1878, Thomas Edison was the first person known to create a machine that would transmit sound and play it through the machine. The machine did not produce music and was used to send messages to others with this device. A piece of tin-foil would be wrapped around and placed in the centre of the cylinder, and while you voice your message, you would turn a handle to do so. While turning the handle, a needle inside would vibrate from the sound of your voice. The vibration from the needle would then create lines on the tinfoil and a second needle inside would project your voice out of the cylinder. Edison prided himself in making the phonograph even though he was hard of hearing, which led him to a new motive in which he wanted to figure out how to play music out of the machine. 
                    
                        Fun Fact: The first song played on the Phonograph, was “Mary Had A Little Lamb”.

                    <h2>Gramophone</h2>
                <div>
                    In 1887, Emile Berliner, a German Inventor, took Edison’s idea with his Phonograph and recreated it as the Gramophone. Unlike the Phonograph, the Gramophone was able to record and play music, with the addition of a flat disc without using tin-foil. The Gramophone consisted of four main parts, a small needle, the groove, the diaphragm and the horn. The needle was attached to the groove and diaphragm and the diaphragm was attached to the horn. The diaphragm was what helped amplify the sounds coming out of the Gramophone. Berliner gives credits to both Edison and a man named Alexander Graham Bell. Bell helped figure out the problem with Edison’s Phonograph and added a floating stylus to help play back the sound in the Gramophone, while also replacing the tin-foil with wax for a longer lasting effect.

                <div>
                    In 1889, an inventor by the name of Louis Glass created a music machine and installed it in a corner of the Palais Royale Saloon in San Francisco. Glass was inspired through Edison's attempt in creating a machine that plays music and customers were able to use it by inserting a nickel that would play a randomize song. As this was the 18th century, amplification was not yet created, therefore customers had to listen to the music through listening tubes that went into the person's ear. With the inserting of a nickel per song, Glass came up with the phrase "nickel-in-the-slot". Over the years, technology advanced and so did the Jukebox as it went through many changes to make it much better, ultimately beating the Gramophone.

                <div>
                    In 1906, the first Vinyl Record was released to go along with the Gramophone. It was said that Emile Berliner had created the first flat disc to go along with the Gramophone, but seems to be fully revitalized and produced in 1906. The vinyl record could be played at 78 revolutions per minute and was able to store 3-5 minutes worth of sound per side. The material used on these older records were much heavier than modern day vinyl records due to the use of shellac resin.

                <div>
                    In the 1930s, Daniel Leland Cooley was the first to create the popularized Turntable.  The turntable was used to play multiple songs at clubs and concert halls. Although the Turntable was created in the 30s, it was popularized more in the 70s. With Turntables, it helped create a new phenomenon amongst DJs in which the term "Scratching" became of existence. This meant when a vinyl disk was placed in the holder, the DJ would move it back and forth to create persuasive sounds.

                <div>
                    The Transistor Radio was created in 1947 by three individuals named William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain. This pocket size radio was very handy amongst people as you were able to listen to pretty much anything you wanted, the broadcast stations, music, AM channels, etc. This device was said to pave the way for other portable hand-held devices as without the transistor, other hand-held devices like our phones, laptops, and iPads would not be here. The Transistor had a huge role in the 20th century in getting more modernized to our time.

                    In 1962, the Philips company came out with a wide length device that was made to listen to music on the go. Much smaller than the Transistor Radio, the Cassette tape was a smaller device that would allow you to play up to 60 minutes worth of songs. The great idea behind the Cassette tape was that you were able to create your own music onto it and it was less technological compared to the past music devices.

                    After the Compact Cassette tape was released, Stereo 8 cartridges, also known as 8-Track Tapes, were introduced to the US market in 1965. Due to their similarity to the Compact Cassette, the 8-Track Tape inventor William Powell Lear made it his mission to have his devices installed into Ford vehicles and many more for them to sell well and stay within the market. The music device functioned similarly to the Compact Cassette, except you did not have to flip the tape over to listen to more songs, unlike the Cassette.

                    In 1982, Philips and Sony collaborated on creating a compatible disc that would be able to hold about 80 minutes of music that could be played loudly in a CD Player. The Compact Disc (CD) was one of the most efficient ways of storing music up to this day. It was much more reliable than the Cassette tape as you were able to skip to a favourite song without having to listen to other songs before it.

                    In 1992, Sony came out with the MiniDisc, a smaller version of the Compact Disc. In order to play the MiniDisc, you had to place the disc that was in a square plastic shell into a small music player, which would then play the songs in the highest quality. It too reached a capacity of 60-80 minutes of music and was easy to take on the go. With the plastic shell protecting the disc, it was much easier to take care of and less likely to break, unlike the compact disc.

                    In 2001, Apple came out with their first MP3 player, the iPod. The iPod was able to store over 1000 songs that you would be able to download from the web into your iPod. You were able to scroll through the songs and see them on the LCD screen, while also using the moveable scroll wheel. Instead of skipping through songs, you were able to select whichever song you wanted to play. The iPod helped boost Apple's revenue and was one of the most popular devices of that year.

                    Created in Stockholm, Sweden in 2006, Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon created and released Spotify in 2008. Spotify was a platform for artists to show their art and share it with beloved fans, without running the danger of having their work stolen or losing any money from it. Up to 100 million tunes and 5 million podcasts could be distributed globally thanks to the software, which also produced a system that let listeners listen to music without advertisements for $10 a month. Soon after, a large number of other programs joined the streaming services, with Apple being Spotify's main competition.
